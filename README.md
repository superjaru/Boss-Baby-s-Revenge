# Revenge Function

- This repository contains the revenge function, a JavaScript function that determines whether the result is "Good boy" or "Bad boy" based on a sequence of characters 'S' and 'R'.

# Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The function iterates through the input string once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as the function uses a fixed amount of extra space (the temp object) regardless of the input size.
